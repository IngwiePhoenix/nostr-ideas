# Nostr Ideas

This is just a collection of ideas that I would like to implement myself, or see others implement, ontop of (Nostr)[https://github.com/nostr-protocol].

Very simple, very basic. :)

The idea is to implement those ideas in NIPs as seen in (the official repo)[https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips]
